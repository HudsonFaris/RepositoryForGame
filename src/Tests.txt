We tried to make it so we could test for configuration loading heavily.
Especially in the case of exceptions. 
We wanted things to be variable for the case of the door count, so we included different examples of that too.
We also implemented certain rooms because they would be tricky to implement
on different csv layouts.

We chose the kitchen for extensive testing because
the kitchen is what drives the house in any situation. 

We chose cell (0, 0) beacuse it's quite simple and easy to check things for.
