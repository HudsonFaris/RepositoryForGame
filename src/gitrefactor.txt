The difference between the refactoring and before refactoring is 
removing unused variables that were either named differently or just never used.

Removed redundant methods and loops to make code simpler and more concise. 
Removed variables that were already being overwritten. 
Removed runaway constants that would cause errors in the future.
Reorganized if statements/case statements.
Reorganized loops as needed. 

We're not entirely sure what you mean by "showing git difference" but I hope this works!
